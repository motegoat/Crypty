Terms of Use
This software, known as "Crypty," is a majestic creation designed to encrypt and decrypt your files with the grace of a thousand dancing penguins. By downloading or using this software, you agree to the following terms and conditions, which are more binding than your grandmother's secret cookie recipe:

Usage: You may use this software for personal and educational purposes. Commercial use is strictly prohibited unless you want to pay us in chocolate chip cookies (which we will gladly accept).

Modification: Feel free to modify the source code, but remember: with great power comes great responsibility. If you break something, you‚Äôre on your own‚Äîour lawyers are busy with other cookie-related matters.

Disclaimer: We take no responsibility for any lost files, corrupted data, or existential crises that may arise from using this software. Use it at your own risk, and maybe back up your important stuff first. Just saying.

Attribution: If you make something cool using this software, please give credit to the creators. You know, like a digital ‚Äúthank you‚Äù or an awkward high-five in the comments.

Limitations: No aliens, robots, or malevolent AI should use this software. If you are an alien, please check with your intergalactic lawyer first.

NOW THEREFORE, BY DOWNLOADING, USING, OR MODIFYING THIS SOFTWARE, YOU AGREE TO THE ABOVE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, STOP HERE AND DELETE THE CRYPTY SOFTWARE (AFTER ADMIRING ITS GENIUS BRIEFLY).

Congratulations!
Bravo! If you‚Äôve read this far, you‚Äôre either a legal aficionado, an insatiably curious mind, or you've lost the ability to scroll. Either way, you've won our undying respect and a hearty digital high-five üñêÔ∏è. Somewhere in the digital ether, a tiny, encrypted confetti cannon has gone off just for you. So go forth, use Crypty with gusto, and may your files be ever safe and your keys forever remembered!
